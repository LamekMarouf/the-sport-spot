# Sport Spot

## Description
Sport Spot is a MERN-stack application. It also includes Sass as a CSS preprocessor. So what is Sport Spot? 
 
Have you ever wanted to see results, reviews and summaries for a sport so you get on google search up Liverpool vs Manchester United results, but you just don’t get all the information you want, so you decide to search Liverpool vs Manchester United highlights. After watching that you want to see other people’s opinions and thoughts on the game so you go searching for that. Now you want to see the results for the NBA finals and this loop repeats. So much searching. Sport Spot solves that problem by having all that information in one spot quickly and reliably. The feature that makes this application stand out from other similar applications is that it has the widest range of sports. Can you think of another app that has sports from basketball, to football, to chess and even Esports. For those of you who don’t know, Esports is the category for videogames that are played competitively by professionals, just as any other professional sport is played. Sport Spot makes finding out results and finding higlights of a major variety of sport quick and simple.
